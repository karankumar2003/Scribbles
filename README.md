# Scribbles

Scribbles is a simple note-taking app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes.  
The notes are stored using Room database and displayed in a staggered recyclerView, which makes it easy to scroll through them quickly.  
In addition, users can add a low, medium, or high priority to their notes, and filter notes based on their priority.   
The app also includes a search feature, making it easy to find specific notes.

This app uses LiveData and Coroutines to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.  
This app follows MVVM architecture.
